# REGRESSION

## California Housing Regression Analysis 🏡📊

This project is a regression analysis assignment that applies various supervised learning algorithms to the California Housing dataset using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📌 Objective

To evaluate the performance of different regression algorithms on a real-world dataset and identify the most effective model for predicting housing prices.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: `fetch_california_housing` from `sklearn.datasets`
- **Target Variable**: `MedHouseVal` (Median House Value)

- **Features**:
  - `MedInc`: Median income in block group
  - `HouseAge`: Median house age in block group
  - `AveRooms`, `AveBedrms`: Average number of rooms/bedrooms
  - `Population`, `AveOccup`: Block group population/occupancy
  - `Latitude`, `Longitude`

## 🔧 Preprocessing Steps

- Loaded dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Checked and confirmed absence of missing values.
- Applied **StandardScaler** for feature scaling to normalize inputs.

🔹 Explanation:
Missing values: Checked with isnull(), though this dataset typically has none.

Scaling: Important for algorithms like SVR and Gradient Boosting which are sensitive to feature magnitude.

🔹 Models and Explanations:
🔸 Linear Regression
How it works: Finds a linear relationship between features and target using least squares.

Suitability: Baseline model, interpretable but limited with non-linear data.

🔸 Decision Tree Regressor
How it works: Splits data into regions by minimizing variance in leaf nodes.

Suitability: Captures non-linearity, prone to overfitting.

🔸 Random Forest Regressor
How it works: Ensemble of decision trees; averages results for better generalization.

Suitability: Good for large, complex datasets.

🔸 Gradient Boosting Regressor
How it works: Builds trees sequentially to minimize errors from previous trees.

Suitability: Strong performance with parameter tuning.

🔸 Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
How it works: Tries to fit data within a threshold (epsilon-insensitive tube).

Suitability: Good for small to medium-sized datasets with scaled features.


## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R² Score (R-squared)**

## 🏆 Results Summary

| Model | MSE | MAE | R² |
|-------|-----|-----|----|
| (Results auto-generated by the notebook will appear here) |

- ✅ **Best Performing Model**: *e.g., Random Forest* — highest R² and lowest errors.
- ❌ **Least Performing Model**: *e.g., SVR* — due to poor fit or scaling issues.
